                <p class="easter-p">After WWI had ended, Sinn Féin had set up the first Dáil in Ireland. 
                    The British declared this illegal and in 1919 war broke out. 
                    The Irish couldn’t defeat the British in a head on war so they decided to ambush the British 
                    with guerrilla forces. They attacked the RIC, the British police who enforced the law and in response, 
                    the British sent their own troops to Ireland. 
                    They were called the Black and Tans by the Irish forces because of their black and tan clothes.
                    After 2 years of fighting and over 2,000 deaths, a truce was called in July 1921 
                    and Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith went to London to negotiate a peace treaty. 
                    The Irish wanted their country to be independent from the British Commonwealth but the British refused. 
                    The British drew up a treaty and threatened war if the Irish did not sign it. 
                    The Irish were forced to sign it. Some of the circumstances of the Treaty were that Ireland 
                    would have its own army and its own currency. When the team  came home, the Irish people 
                    were angry that Ireland had not became a Republic .
