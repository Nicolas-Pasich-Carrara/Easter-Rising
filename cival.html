                    With the Anglo-Irish treaty established Ireland saw the end of the war with Great Britain. 
                    However, many people war unhappy with the treaty and angry at Michael Collins 
                    as he only brought partial freedom to Ireland, not full freedom. 
                    There were also 6 counties in the North (Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry, Down and Antrim) 
                    that were not part of Ireland and had became there own separate country called Northern Ireland 
                    ruled by Great Britain. In 1922 a war broke out between the people who were happy with the treaty 
                    (pro-treaty) and people who were unhappy with the treaty (anti-treaty). 
                    The main leader of the pro treaty side was Michael Collins, and the main leader on the anti-treaty 
                    side was Eamon De Valera. At this time they were both part of the IRA(Irish Republican Army) 
                    but the majority of the IRA was on the anti-treaty side. After almost 11 months of fighting, 
                    the people on the ant-treaty side surrendered. 
                    In total there were about 600 deaths including the death of Michael Collins, 
                    and numerous properties destroyed.
