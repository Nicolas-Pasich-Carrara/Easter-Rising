                <p class="easter-p">In 1914, a home rule bill was cast by Ireland and it was passed by the British
                    parliament.
                    However, it had to be postponed due to the outbreak of World War I.
                    The Irish were angry and planned an uprising in Easter.
                    Unfortunately, the ammunition that was being smuggled in by boat had been seized by the British.
                    However they still went with the uprising. On the 24th of April, 2,558 volunteers
                    from the Irish Republican Brotherhood, Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan
                    took control of the GPO, Jacobs Biscuit Factory, Four Courts, Stephensâ€™s Green and Boland Mill.
                    The Proclamation was read out on the steps of the GPO by Padraig Pearse, one of the rebel leaders.
                    This was followed by fighting between the British. Despite seizing plenty of ammunition,
                    they had run out of it after just a few days.
                    The Irish were outnumbered with about 10,000 British soldiers encircling Dublin city.
                    They had even sent a gunboat called the Helga up the river Liffy to destroy the Irish defences.
                    After about 6 days, the Irish surrendered to the British and the leaders of the uprising,
                    Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Thomas Clarke , Sean Mac Dermott, Joseph Mary Plunkett,
                    Eamonn Ceannt, and Thomas MacDonagh were all executed in a prison called Kilmainham Goal.
